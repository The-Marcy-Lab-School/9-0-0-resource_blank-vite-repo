# Blank Starter Repo

You should not use this repo for your projects, this is just for you to quickly follow along in lecture. Clone down this repo before lecture begins to follow along if you'd like. Run `npm i && npm run dev` when you're ready to get started.

When you're going for your own projects, run `npm create vite` to get the latest updates (which this may not have).
